### Overview of Rust and Its Key Features

Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on safety, speed, and concurrency. It was developed by Mozilla and has gained popularity for its ability to provide memory safety without a garbage collector, which makes it particularly suitable for performance-critical applications.

### Key Features of Rust

1. **Memory Safety:**
   - Rust's ownership and borrowing system ensures that memory is managed safely without the need for a garbage collector.
   - This eliminates common issues like null pointer dereferencing and data races.

2. **Performance:**
   - Rust offers high performance, comparable to C and C++, while maintaining safety.
   - It allows fine-grained control over system resources, making it ideal for system-level programming.

3. **Concurrency:**
   - Rust's design supports writing safe concurrent code.
   - Its message-passing concurrency model helps avoid data races and other concurrency pitfalls.

4. **Zero-Cost Abstractions:**
   - Rust provides high-level abstractions that do not incur runtime overhead.
   - This means you can write safe and abstract code without sacrificing performance.

5. **Compiler Warnings and Errors:**
   - The Rust compiler is very strict and provides clear error messages.
   - It helps catch potential issues early in the development process.

6. **Extensive Standard Library:**
   - Rust comes with a rich standard library that includes many useful data structures and utilities.
   - This reduces the need to write boilerplate code and speeds up development.

## 1.2 Setting Up the Development Environment

### Installing Rust Using `rustup`

`rustup` is the official toolchain installer for Rust. It simplifies the process of installing and managing Rust on your system. Here’s how to install Rust using `rustup`:

1. **Download and Install `rustup`:**
   - **Windows:**
     - Go to the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and download the installer for Windows.
     - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
   - **Linux:**
     - Open a terminal and run the following command:

       ```bash

       ```

     - Alternatively, you can use the same command as for Linux.

2. **Verify the Installation:**
   - After installation, verify that Rust is correctly installed by checking the versions of `rustc` (the Rust compiler) and `cargo` (the package manager):

     ```bash
     rustc --version
     cargo --version
     ```

   - You should see the installed versions of `rustc` and `cargo`.

### Updating and Uninstalling Rust

- **Updating Rust:**
  - To update Rust to the latest stable version, simply run:

    ```bash
    rustup update
    ```

  - You can also switch between different versions of Rust if needed:

    ```bash
    rustup toolchain list
    rustup toolchain install nightly
    rustup default nightly
    ```

- **Uninstalling Rust:**
  - To uninstall Rust, you can remove the `rustup` directory:
    - **Windows:** delete the `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.rustup` directory.
    - **Linux/macOS:** delete the `~/.rustup` directory.
  - Alternatively, you can use the `rustup` command to uninstall specific toolchains:

    ```bash
    rustup toolchain uninstall nightly
    ```

### Configuring Popular Editors/IDEs

To make Rust development more efficient, you can configure popular editors and IDEs with Rust plugins:

1. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):**
   - Install VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
   - Open VS Code and go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS).
   - Search for and install the `Rust (rls)` or `Rust Analyzer` extension.
   - Rust Analyzer is recommended for its better performance and features.

2. **IntelliJ IDEA:**
   - Download and install IntelliJ IDEA (Community or Ultimate edition).
   - Go to `File > Settings > Plugins`.
   - Search for the `Rust` plugin and install it.
   - Restart IntelliJ IDEA after installation.

3. **Atom:**
   - Install Atom from the [official website](https://atom.io/).
   - Open Atom and go to `Edit > Preferences > Install`.
   - Search for the `linter-rust` and `language-rust` packages and install them.

### Setting Up a Basic Project

Once your environment is set up, you can create and run your first Rust project:

1. **Create a New Project Using `cargo`:**

   ```bash
   cargo new my_project
   cd my_project
   ```

2. **Compile and Run the Project:**

   ```bash
   cargo build
   cargo run
   ```

By the end of this section, you should have a fully functional Rust development environment set up on your machine. You should be able to install, update, and uninstall Rust, as well as configure your preferred editor or IDE for Rust development. This foundation will enable you to start writing and running Rust code effectively.

## 1.3 Writing Your First Rust Program

### Creating a Simple "Hello, World!" Program

Rust is known for its simplicity and clarity, especially when it comes to writing basic programs. Let’s start by creating a simple “Hello, World!” program to get familiar with the syntax and structure of Rust.

1. **Creating a New Project:**
   - Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new Rust project:

     ```bash
     cargo new hello_world
     cd hello_world
     ```

   - This command does several things:
     - Creates a new directory named `hello_world`.
     - Initializes a new Rust project with a basic file structure.
     - Generates a `Cargo.toml` file (the project manifest) and a `src/main.rs` file (the main source file).

2. **Exploring the Project Structure:**
   - **`Cargo.toml`:** this file contains metadata about your project, such as the project name, version, and dependencies.
   - **`src/main.rs`:** this is the main source file where you write your Rust code.

3. **Writing the Code:**
   - Open `src/main.rs` in your favorite editor. By default, it contains the following code:

     ```rust
     fn main() {
         println!("Hello, world!");
     }
     ```

   - Here’s a breakdown of the code:
     - `fn main() {` defines the main function, which is the entry point of a Rust program.
     - `println!` is a macro used to print text to the console. The exclamation mark (`!`) indicates that it’s a macro, not a regular function.
     - `"Hello, world!"` is the string that will be printed to the console.

4. **Compiling and Running the Program:**
   - To compile the program, run:

     ```bash
     cargo build
     ```

   - This command compiles your code and generates an executable file.
   - To run the program, use:

     ```bash
     cargo run
     ```

   - You should see the output:

     ```text
     Hello, world!
     ```

### Understanding Basic Syntax and Conventions

Let’s take a closer look at some key aspects of the syntax and conventions in Rust:

1. **Functions:**
   - Functions in Rust are defined using the `fn` keyword.
   - The `main` function is special because it’s the entry point of the program.
   - Functions can take parameters and return values, but in this simple example, `main` takes no parameters and returns `()` (the unit type, indicating no return value).

2. **Macros:**
   - `println!` is a macro, not a function. Macros in Rust allow you to generate code at compile time.
   - Macros are useful for tasks that require more complex code generation than what regular functions can provide.

3. **Comments:**
   - Rust supports two types of comments:
     - **Line comments:** start with `//` and continue to the end of the line.
     - **Block comments:** start with `/*` and end with `*/`, allowing multi-line comments.
   - Example:

     ```rust
     // This is a line comment
     /*
      * This is a block comment
      * spanning multiple lines
      */
     ```

4. **Whitespace and Formatting:**
   - Rust is whitespace-insensitive, meaning that extra spaces and tabs generally don’t affect the code’s meaning.
   - However, consistent formatting is encouraged for readability. Tools like `rustfmt` can automatically format your code according to Rust’s style guidelines.

### Practicing with Simple Modifications

To reinforce your understanding, try making some simple modifications to the “Hello, World!” program:

- Change the printed message to something else, like `"Welcome to Rust!"`.
- Add a few line comments explaining different parts of the code.
- Create a new function that prints a different message and call it from `main`.

By the end of this section, you should be able to create, compile, and run a basic Rust program. You should also have a basic understanding of Rust’s syntax, including functions, macros, and comments. This foundation will prepare you for more complex programming concepts in the following lessons.

## 1.4 Understanding Cargo and Project Management

### Introduction to Cargo

Cargo is Rust’s official build system and package manager. It simplifies the process of managing Rust projects by handling tasks such as:

- Building and compiling code.
- Managing dependencies.
- Running tests.
- Generating documentation.
- Publishing packages to crates.io (Rust’s official package registry).

### Why Use Cargo?

Using Cargo offers several advantages:

- **Consistency:** ensures that projects are set up and built consistently.
- **Dependency Management:** automatically handles downloading and compiling dependencies.
- **Simplified Workflow:** provides a unified interface for common tasks, reducing the need for manual configuration.
- **Reproducibility:** the `Cargo.lock` file ensures that builds are reproducible across different environments.

### Exploring the `Cargo.toml` File

The `Cargo.toml` file is the heart of any Cargo-managed project. It contains metadata and configuration for your project. Here’s a basic example:

```toml
[package]
name = "my_project"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"
authors = ["Your Name <your.email@example.com>"]

[dependencies]
serde = "1.0"
```

- **`[package]` section:** contains metadata about your project, such as the name, version, and authors.
- **`edition`:** specifies the Rust edition (e.g., `2024`) which enables certain language features.
- **`[dependencies]` section:** lists the external crates (libraries) your project depends on, along with their version constraints.

### Common Cargo Commands

Here are some essential Cargo commands you should know:

1. **Creating a New Project:**

   ```bash
   cargo new my_project
   ```

2. **Building the Project:**

   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

   - This command compiles your code and generates an executable in the `target/debug` directory.

3. **Running the Project:**

   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

   - This command compiles and runs your program in one step.

4. **Adding Dependencies:**
   - Edit the `Cargo.toml` file to add dependencies, then run:

     ```bash
     cargo build
     ```

   - Cargo will automatically download and compile the required dependencies.

5. **Running Tests:**

   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

   - This command runs all the tests in your project.

6. **Generating Documentation:**

   ```bash
   cargo doc
   ```

   - Generates HTML documentation for your project and its dependencies.

7. **Searching for Crates:**

   ```bash
   cargo search serde
   ```

   - Searches for crates on crates.io.

8. **Updating Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cargo update
   ```

   - Updates your project’s dependencies to their latest compatible versions.

### Understanding the Project Structure

A typical Cargo project has the following structure:

```text
my_project/
├── Cargo.toml
├── src/
│   └── main.rs
└── target/
    └── debug/
        └── my_project
```

- **`Cargo.toml`:** project manifest file.
- **`src/` directory:** contains the source code files.
  - **`main.rs`:** the main entry point for binary projects.
- **`target/` directory:** contains build artifacts (executables, object files, etc.).

### Managing Dependencies

Dependencies in Rust are managed through crates, which are the unit of distribution in the Rust ecosystem. To add a dependency:

1. Find the crate on [crates.io](https://crates.io).
2. Add it to the `[dependencies]` section of your `Cargo.toml` file.
3. Run `cargo build` to download and compile the dependency.

For example, to add the `serde` crate:

```toml
[dependencies]
serde = "1.0"
```

By the end of this section, you should understand the role of Cargo in Rust development and be able to manage basic Rust projects using Cargo. You should also be familiar with the `Cargo.toml` file, common Cargo commands, and how to manage dependencies in your projects. This knowledge will be essential as you progress to more advanced topics in Rust programming.

## 1.5 Working with Rust Data Types and Basic Syntax

### Introduction to Rust Data Types

Rust is a statically typed language, meaning that the type of a variable is known at compile time. This provides safety and performance benefits. Rust has several built-in data types, which can be categorized into scalar and compound types.

#### Scalar Types

Scalar types represent single values. The main scalar types in Rust are:

1. **Integers:**
   - Signed integers: `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, `isize` (depends on the platform).
   - Unsigned integers: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `usize` (depends on the platform).
   - Example:

     ```rust
     let age: i32 = 30;
     let size: usize = 1024;
     ```

2. **Floating-Point Numbers:**
   - `f32` (32-bit floating point).
   - `f64` (64-bit floating point, default).
   - Example:

     ```rust
     let pi: f64 = 3.14159;
     ```

3. **Booleans:**
   - Represented by the `bool` type, with values `true` and `false`.
   - Example:

     ```rust
     let is_raining: bool = false;
     ```

4. **Characters:**
   - Represented by the `char` type, which is a Unicode scalar value.
   - Example:

     ```rust
     let letter: char = 'A';
     ```

#### Compound Types

Compound types group multiple values into a single type. The main compound types in Rust are:

1. **Tuples:**
   - Tuples can hold a fixed number of values of different types.
   - Example:

     ```rust
     let person = (30, "Alice", true); // (age, name, is_student)
     println!("Age: {}", person.0); // Accessing tuple elements by index
     ```

2. **Arrays:**
   - Arrays have a fixed size and hold elements of the same type.
   - Example:

     ```rust
     let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     println!("First element: {}", numbers[0]);
     ```

### Variables and Mutability

- Variables in Rust are immutable by default. To declare a mutable variable, use the `mut` keyword:

  ```rust
  let mut count = 0;
  count += 1; // This is allowed because count is mutable
  ```

### Basic Control Flow

Rust provides several control flow constructs to manage the execution of your code:

1. **If Statements:**
   - Used for conditional execution.
   - Example:

     ```rust
     let number = 10;
     if number % 2 == 0 {
         println!("The number is even");
     } else {
         println!("The number is odd");
     }
     ```

2. **Loops:**
   - Rust has several loop constructs:
     - `loop`: an infinite loop that requires a `break` statement to exit.
     - `while`: executes as long as a condition is true.
     - `for`: iterates over a collection.
   - Examples:

     ```rust
     // Infinite loop with break
     loop {
         println!("This will run forever... unless we break!");
         break;
     }

     // While loop
     let mut i = 0;
     while i < 5 {
         println!("{}", i);
         i += 1;
     }

     // For loop
     for i in 0..5 {
         println!("{}", i);
     }
     ```

### Functions Revisited

Functions in Rust can take parameters and return values. Here’s an example of a function that calculates the factorial of a number:

```rust
fn factorial(n: u32) -> u32 {
  if n == 0 {
    1
  } else {
    n * factorial(n - 1)
  }
}

fn main() {
  let num = 5;
  let result = factorial(num);
  println!("The factorial of {} is {}", num, result);
}
```

## 1.6 Working with Strings and String Types in Rust

### Understanding String Types in Rust

Rust provides two main ways to work with strings: string literals and the `String` type. Each has its own use cases and characteristics.

#### String Literals

- String literals are immutable and hardcoded into the executable at compile time.
- They are enclosed in double quotes (`""`).
- Example:

  ```rust
  let greeting = "Hello, world!";
  ```

- Characteristics:
  - Immutable: you cannot change the contents of a string literal.
  - Known at compile time: the value must be determined when the program is compiled.
  - Stored in read-only memory.

#### The `String` Type

- The `String` type is mutable and can be dynamically allocated on the heap.
- It is suitable for strings that need to be modified or grow in size.
- Example:

  ```rust
  let mut message = String::from("Hello, ");
  message.push_str("world!");
  println!("{}", message); // Output: Hello, world!
  ```

- Characteristics:
  - Mutable: you can modify the contents of a `String`.
  - Dynamically allocated: memory is allocated on the heap, allowing the string to grow and shrink as needed.
  - UTF-8 encoded: supports a wide range of characters.

### Creating and Manipulating `String` Objects

1. **Creating a `String`:**
   - From a string literal:

     ```rust
     let s1 = String::from("initial contents");
     ```

   - Using the `to_string()` method:

     ```rust
     let s2 = "initial contents".to_string();
     ```

2. **Appending to a `String`:**
   - Use `push_str()` to append a string slice:

     ```rust
     let mut s = String::from("foo");
     s.push_str("bar"); // s is now "foobar"
     ```

   - Use `push()` to append a single character:

     ```rust
     let mut s = String::from("lo");
     s.push('l'); // s is now "lol"
     ```

3. **Concatenating Strings:**
   - Use the `+` operator with string slices:

     ```rust
     let s1 = String::from("Hello, ");
     let s2 = "world!";
     let s3 = s1 + s2; // s1 is moved here and cannot be used afterward
     ```

   - Note: the `+` operator moves ownership of the left-hand side string, so `s1` cannot be used after the concatenation.

4. **Using the `format!` Macro:**
   - The `format!` macro provides a flexible way to create strings:

     ```rust
     let x = 5;
     let y = 10;
     let result = format!("The sum of {} and {} is {}", x, y, x + y);
     println!("{}", result); // Output: The sum of 5 and 10 is 15
     ```

### Common Methods for String Manipulation

- `len()`: returns the number of bytes in the string.
- `is_empty()`: checks if the string is empty.
- `contains()`: checks if the string contains a substring.
- `to_uppercase()` and `to_lowercase()`: convert the string to uppercase or lowercase.
- `trim()`: removes whitespace from the beginning and end of the string.

Example:

```rust
let s = String::from("  Hello, world!  ");
println!("Length: {}", s.len()); // Output: Length: 16
println!("Is empty? {}", s.is_empty()); // Output: Is empty? false
println!("Contains 'world'? {}", s.contains("world")); // Output: Contains 'world'? true
println!("Trimmed: '{}'", s.trim()); // Output: Trimmed: 'Hello, world!'
```

### Working with UTF-8 Characters

- Rust strings are UTF-8 encoded, which means they can represent a wide range of characters from different languages.
- The `char` type represents a single Unicode scalar value, which may consist of one or more bytes in UTF-8 encoding.
- Example:

  ```rust
  let hello = "Здравствуйте!"; // A string with Cyrillic characters
  for c in hello.chars() {
      println!("{}", c); // Prints each character on a new line
  }
  ```

## 1.7 Working with Collections in Rust

### Introduction to Collections

Collections in Rust are used to store and manage groups of data. Rust provides several built-in collection types, each with its own characteristics and use cases. The main collection types are vectors, arrays, and hash maps.

#### Vectors

Vectors (`Vec<T>`) are dynamic arrays that can grow and shrink in size. They are part of the standard library and are very commonly used in Rust.

1. **Creating Vectors:**
   - Using the `vec!` macro:

     ```rust
     let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     ```

   - Creating an empty vector:

     ```rust
     let mut v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
     ```

2. **Adding Elements:**
   - Use the `push` method to add elements to the end of a vector:

     ```rust
     v.push(6);
     ```

3. **Accessing Elements:**
   - Access elements using indexing:

     ```rust
     let third = v[2]; // Accessing the third element
     ```

   - Use the `get` method for safer access (returns an `Option`):

     ```rust
     match v.get(10) {
         Some(value) => println!("Value: {}", value),
         None => println!("Index out of bounds"),
     }
     ```

4. **Iterating Over Vectors:**
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate over elements:

     ```rust
     for i in &v {
         println!("{}", i);
     }
     ```

#### Arrays

Arrays have a fixed size and hold elements of the same type. They are useful when you know the size of the collection at compile time.

1. **Declaring Arrays:**

   ```rust
   let months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];
   ```

2. **Accessing Elements:**
   - Similar to vectors, you can access elements using indexing:

     ```rust
     let first_month = months[0];
     ```

3. **Array Length:**
   - The length of an array is part of its type, so you can get it using the `len` method:

     ```rust
     println!("Number of months: {}", months.len());
     ```

#### Hash Maps

Hash maps (`HashMap<K, V>`) are collections of key-value pairs. They provide fast lookups, insertions, and deletions based on keys.

1. **Creating a Hash Map:**
   - Import the `HashMap` type from the standard library:

     ```rust
     use std::collections::HashMap;
     ```

   - Create an empty hash map:

     ```rust
     let mut scores = HashMap::new();
     ```

   - Initialize with values using the `insert` method:

     ```rust
     scores.insert("Alice", 100);
     scores.insert("Bob", 95);
     ```

2. **Accessing Values:**
   - Use the `get` method to retrieve values:

     ```rust
     match scores.get("Alice") {
         Some(score) => println!("Alice's score: {}", score),
         None => println!("Alice not found"),
     }
     ```

3. **Iterating Over Hash Maps:**
   - Iterate over key-value pairs:

     ```rust
     for (key, value) in &scores {
         println!("{}: {}", key, value);
     }
     ```

### Common Collection Operations

- **Checking for Existence:**
  - Use the `contains_key` method for hash maps:

    ```rust
    if scores.contains_key("Charlie") {
        println!("Charlie is in the scores");
    } else {
        println!("Charlie is not in the scores");
    }
    ```

- **Removing Elements:**
  - Remove elements from a hash map using the `remove` method:

    ```rust
    scores.remove("Bob");
    ```

By the end of this section, you should understand how to work with vectors, arrays, and hash maps in Rust. You should be able to create, manipulate, and iterate over these collections, as well as perform common operations such as adding, accessing, and removing elements. This knowledge will be essential for managing data in your Rust programs.

## 1.8 Control Flow in Rust: Loops and Conditionals

### Understanding Control Flow

Control flow in programming refers to the order in which statements are executed. Rust provides several constructs to control the flow of your program, including conditionals and loops.

### Conditionals: `if`, `else if`, and `else`

Conditionals allow you to execute code based on whether a certain condition is true or false.

1. **Basic `if` Statement:**

   ```rust
   let number = 10;
   if number > 0 {
       println!("The number is positive");
   }
   ```

2. **`else if` for Multiple Conditions:**

   ```rust
   let number = -5;
   if number > 0 {
       println!("The number is positive");
   } else if number < 0 {
       println!("The number is negative");
   } else {
       println!("The number is zero");
   }
   ```

3. **Using `match` for Pattern Matching:**
   The `match` expression is a powerful tool for controlling flow based on patterns. It can be used to match values against multiple patterns.

   ```rust
   let x = 5;
   match x {
       1 => println!("One"),
       2 => println!("Two"),
       3 | 4 | 5 => println!("Three to Five"),
       _ => println!("Something else"),
   }
   ```

### Loops in Rust

Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. Rust provides several loop constructs:

1. **`loop` (Infinite Loop):**
   - The `loop` keyword creates an infinite loop that must be explicitly exited using the `break` statement.

   ```rust
   loop {
       println!("This loop will run forever... unless we break!");
       break; // This statement is necessary to exit the loop
   }
   ```

2. **`while` Loop:**
   - Executes as long as a condition is true.

   ```rust
   let mut i = 0;
   while i < 5 {
       println!("{}", i);
       i += 1;
   }
   ```

3. **`for` Loop:**
   - Used for iterating over a range or collection.

   ```rust
   for i in 0..5 {
       println!("{}", i);
   }

   // Iterating over an array
   let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
   for number in numbers.iter() {
       println!("Number: {}", number);
   }
   ```

### Loop Control Statements

- **`break`:** exits the loop immediately.

  ```rust
  loop {
      println!("Looping...");
      if some_condition {
          break; // Exit the loop if the condition is met
      }
  }
  ```

- **`continue`:** skips the rest of the current iteration and proceeds to the next one.

  ```rust
  for i in 0..10 {
      if i % 2 == 0 {
          continue; // Skip even numbers
      }
      println!("Odd number: {}", i);
  }
  ```

### Nested Loops

You can nest loops inside each other. The `break` and `continue` statements affect the innermost loop by default. To control outer loops, you can use labeled loops:

```rust
'outer: loop {
    println!("Outer loop");
    'inner: loop {
        println!("Inner loop");
        break 'outer; // This will break out of the outer loop
    }
}
```

By the end of this section, you should understand how to use conditionals and loops in Rust to control the flow of your programs. You should be able to write code that makes decisions based on conditions and repeats actions using different types of loops. This knowledge is essential for writing more complex and dynamic Rust applications.

## 1.9 Functions in Rust

### Introduction to Functions

Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task and can be called by name. They help in organizing code, promoting reusability, and making programs more modular.

### Defining Functions

In Rust, functions are defined using the `fn` keyword. Here’s the basic syntax:

```rust
fn function_name(parameters) -> return_type {
    // Function body
    return expression;
}
```

- **Function Name:** choose a descriptive name for your function.
- **Parameters:** specify the input values the function takes. Parameters are optional.
- **Return Type:** specify the type of value the function returns. The `->` symbol is used to denote the return type. If the function doesn’t return a value, use `()` (the unit type).
- **Function Body:** contains the statements and expressions that define what the function does.

**Example:**

```rust
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

fn main() {
    let sum = add(3, 5);
    println!("The sum is: {}", sum); // Output: The sum is: 8
}
```

### Return Values

- In Rust, the last expression in a function is implicitly returned. You can also use the `return` keyword to explicitly return a value.
- Example with explicit return:

  ```rust
  fn greet(name: &str) -> String {
      return format!("Hello, {}!", name);
  }
  ```

### Functions Without Return Values

- If a function doesn’t need to return a value, you can use the unit type `()` as the return type:

  ```rust
  fn print_greeting() {
      println!("Hello, world!");
  }
  ```

### Function Parameters

- Parameters are variables that hold the values passed to the function when it is called.
- You can define multiple parameters by separating them with commas:

  ```rust
  fn multiply(a: f64, b: f64) -> f64 {
      a * b
  }
  ```

### Default Parameters and Function Overloading

- Rust does not support default parameters or function overloading in the traditional sense. However, you can achieve similar behavior using optional parameters with `Option<T>` or by defining multiple functions with different names.

**Example with `Option<T>`:**

```rust
fn greet(name: Option<&str>) {
    match name {
        Some(n) => println!("Hello, {}!", n),
        None => println!("Hello, stranger!"),
    }
}

fn main() {
    greet(Some("Alice")); // Output: Hello, Alice!
    greet(None); // Output: Hello, stranger!
}
```

### Recursive Functions

- Functions can call themselves, which is known as recursion. This is useful for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems.
- Example: calculating factorial

  ```rust
  fn factorial(n: u32) -> u32 {
      if n == 0 {
          1
      } else {
          n * factorial(n - 1)
      }
  }

  fn main() {
      let num = 5;
      println!("Factorial of {} is {}", num, factorial(num)); // Output: Factorial of 5 is 120
  }
  ```

### Closures

- Closures are anonymous functions that can capture variables from their environment. They are often used for callbacks or higher-order functions.
- Syntax:

  ```rust
  let closure = |x: i32, y: i32| x + y;
  let result = closure(3, 4);
  println!("Result: {}", result); // Output: Result: 7
  ```

By the end of this section, you should understand how to define and use functions in Rust, including working with parameters, return values, and closures. Functions are a fundamental part of Rust programming, and mastering them will help you write more organized and efficient code.
