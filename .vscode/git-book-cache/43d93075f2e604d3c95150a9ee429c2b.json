 <h2 id=\"_git_help\">Getting Help</h2>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you ever need help while using Git, there are three equivalent ways to get the comprehensive manual page (manpage) help for any of the Git commands:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"listingblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"language-console\" data-lang=\"console\">$ git help &lt;verb&gt;\n$ git &lt;verb&gt; --help\n$ man git-&lt;verb&gt;</code></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>For example, you can get the manpage help for the <code>git config</code> command by running this:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"listingblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"language-console\" data-lang=\"console\">$ git help config</code></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>These commands are nice because you can access them anywhere, even offline.\nIf the manpages and this book aren’t enough and you need in-person help, you can try the <code>#git</code>, <code>#github</code>, or <code>#gitlab</code> channels on the Libera Chat IRC server, which can be found at <a href=\"https://libera.chat/\" class=\"bare\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://libera.chat/</a>.\nThese channels are regularly filled with hundreds of people who are all very knowledgeable about Git and are often willing to help.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In addition, if you don’t need the full-blown manpage help, but just need a quick refresher on the available options for a Git command, you can ask for the more concise “help” output with the <code>-h</code> option, as in:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"listingblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"language-console\" data-lang=\"console\">$ git add -h\nusage: git add [&lt;options&gt;] [--] &lt;pathspec&gt;...\n\n    -n, --dry-run               dry run\n    -v, --verbose               be verbose\n\n    -i,
