         <h2 id=\"_first_time\">First-Time Git Setup</h2>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Now that you have Git on your system, you’ll want to do a few things to customize your Git environment.\nYou should have to do these things only once on any given computer; they’ll stick around between upgrades.\nYou can also change them at any time by running through the commands again.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Git comes with a tool called <code>git config</code> that lets you get and set configuration variables that control all aspects of how Git looks and operates.\nThese variables can be stored in three different places:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"olist arabic\">\n<ol class=\"arabic\">\n<li>\n<p><code>[path]/etc/gitconfig</code> file: Contains values applied to every user on the system and all their repositories.\nIf you pass the option <code>--system</code> to <code>git config</code>, it reads and writes from this file specifically.\nBecause this is a system configuration file, you would need administrative or superuser privilege to make changes to it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>~/.gitconfig</code> or <code>~/.config/git/config</code> file: Values specific personally to you, the user.\nYou can make Git read and write to this file specifically by passing the <code>--global</code> option, and this affects <em>all</em> of the repositories you work with on your system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>config</code> file in the Git directory (that is, <code>.git/config</code>) of whatever repository you’re currently using: Specific to that single repository.\nYou can force Git to read from and write to this file with the <code>--local</code> option, but that is in fact the default.\nUnsurprisingly, you need to be located somewhere in a Git repository for this option to work properly.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Each level overrides values in the previous level, so values in <code>.git/config</code> trump those in <code>[path]/etc/gitconfig</code>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>On Windows systems, Git looks for the <code>.gitconfig</code> file in the <code>$HOME</code> directory (<code>C:\\Users\\$USER</code> for most people).\nIt also still looks for <code>[path]/etc/gitconfig</code>, although it’s relative to the MSys root, which is wherever you decide to install Git on your Windows system when you run the installer.\nIf you are using version 2.x or later of Git for Windows, there is also a system-level config file at <code>C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\Git\\config</code> on Windows XP, and in <code>C:\\ProgramData\\Git\\config</code> on Windows Vista and newer.\nThis config file can only be changed by <code>git config -f &lt;file&gt;</code> as an admin.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>You can view all of your settings and where they are coming from using:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"listingblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"language-console\" data-lang=\"console\">$ git config --list --show-origin</code></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h3 id=\"_your_identity\">Your Identity</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address.\nThis is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it’s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"listingblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"language-console\" data-lang=\"console\">$ git config --global user.name \"John Doe\"\n$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com</code></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Again, you need to do this only once if you pass the <code>--global</code> option, because then Git will always use that information for your user on that system.\nIf you want to override this with a different name or email address for specific projects, you can run the command without the <code>--global</code> option when you’re in that project.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Many of the GUI tools will help you do this when you first run them.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h3 id=\"_editor\">Your Editor</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Now that your identity is set up, you can configure the default text editor that will be used when Git needs you to type in a message.\nIf not configured, Git uses your system’s default editor.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you want to use a different text editor, such as Emacs, you can do the following:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"listingblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"language-console\" data-lang=\"console\">$ git config --global core.editor emacs</code></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>On a Windows system, if you want to use a different text editor, you must specify the full path to its executable file.\nThis can be different depending on how your editor is packaged.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In the case of Notepad++, a popular programming editor, you are likely to want to use the 32-bit version, since at the time of writing the 64-bit

         1.6 Getting Started - First-Time Git Setup\n            <div>\n              First-Time Git Setup\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Now that you have Git on your system, you’ll want to do a few things to customize your Git environment.\nYou should have to do these things only once on any given computer; they’ll stick around between upgrades.\nYou can also change them at any time by running through the commands again.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Git comes with a tool called <code>git config</code> that lets you get and set configuration variables that control all aspects of how Git looks and operates.\nThese variables can be stored in three different places:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"olist arabic\">\n<ol class=\"arabic\">\n<li>\n<p><code>[path]/etc/gitconfig</code> file: Contains values applied to every user on the system and all their repositories.\nIf you pass the option <code>--system</code> to <code>git config</code>, it reads and writes from this file specifically.\nBecause this is a system configuration file, you would need administrative or superuser privilege to make changes to it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>~/.gitconfig</code> or <code>~/.config/git/config</code> file: Values specific personally to you, the user.\nYou can make Git read and write to this file specifically by passing the <code>--global</code> option, and this affects <em>all</em> of the repositories you work with on your system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>config</code> file in the Git directory (that is, <code>.git/config</code>) of whatever repository you’re currently using: Specific to that single repository.\nYou can force Git to read from and write to this file with the <code>--local</code> option, but that is in fact the default.\nUnsurprisingly, you need to be located somewhere in a Git repository for this option to work properly.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Each level overrides values in the previous level, so values in <code>.git/config</code> trump those in <code>[path]/etc/gitconfig</code>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>On Windows systems, Git looks for the <code>.gitconfig</code> file in the <code>$HOME</code> directory (<code>C:\\Users\\$USER</code> for most people).\nIt also still looks for <code>[path]/etc/gitconfig</code>, although it’s relative to the MSys root, which is wherever you decide to install Git on your Windows system when you run the installer.\nIf you are using version 2.x or later of Git for Windows, there is also a system-level config file at <code>C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\Git\\config</code> on Windows XP, and in <code>C:\\ProgramData\\Git\\config</code> on Windows Vista and newer.\nThis config file can only be changed by <code>git config -f &lt;file&gt;</code> as an admin.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>You can view all of your settings and where they are coming from using:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"listingblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"language-console\" data-lang=\"console\">$ git config --list --show-origin</code></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\nYour Identity\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address.\nThis is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it’s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"listingblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"language-console\" data-lang=\"console\">$ git config --global user.name \"John Doe\"\n$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com</code></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Again, you need to do this only once if you pass the <code>--global</code> option, because then Git will always use that information for your user on that system.\nIf you want to override this with a different name or email address for specific projects, you can run the command without the <code>--global</code> option when you’re in that project.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Many of the GUI tools will help you do this when you first run them.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\nYour Editor\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Now that your identity is set up, you can configure the default text editor that will be used when Git needs you to type in a message.\nIf not configured, Git uses your system’s default editor.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you want to use a different text editor, such as Emacs, you can do the following:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"listingblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"language-console\" data-lang=\"console\">$ git config --global core.editor emacs</code></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>On a Windows system, if you want to use a different text editor, you must specify the full path to its executable file.\nThis can be different depending on how your editor is packaged.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In the case of Notepad++, a popular programming editor, you are likely to want to use the 32-bit version, since at the time of writing the 64-bit version doesn’t support all plug-ins.\nIf you are on a 32-bit Windows system, or you have a 64-bit editor on a 64-bit system, you’ll type something like this:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"listingblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"language-console\" data-lang=\"console\">$ git config --global core.editor
