# Task: Create methods that combine strings in different ways

# 1. Create a method combine_words that takes two words and returns them with a space
#    Example: combine_words("Hello", "World") => "Hello World"
#    Hint: Use + operator: word1 + ' ' + word2

def combine_words(word1, word2)
  # Your code here

end

# 2. Create a method full_name that takes first and last name
#    Example: full_name("John", "Doe") => "John Doe"
#    Hint: Use string interpolation: "#{first} #{last}"

def full_name(first, last)
  # Your code here

end

# 3. Create a method greeting that takes a name and returns a greeting
#    Example: greeting("Alice") => "Hello, Alice! Welcome!"
#    Hint: Combine multiple strings with spaces and punctuation

def greeting(name)
  # Your code here

end
