# Variables and Data Types Exercise
# Practice creating variables and working with different data types

# Instructions:
# Ruby has different data types: strings, integers, floats, booleans, etc.
# Variables store values and can be reassigned to different values.

# Your task is to create methods that return different data types.
# Look at the test failures to understand what each method should do.

# 1. Create a method that returns your favorite programming language as a string
def favorite_language
  # Return a string value
  "Ruby"
end

# 2. Create a method that returns your age as an integer  
def my_age
  # Return an integer value
  30
end

# 3. Create a method that checks if Ruby is awesome (return true)
def ruby_is_awesome?
  # Your code here
  true
end
