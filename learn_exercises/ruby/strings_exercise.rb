# Working with Strings Exercise
# Practice string manipulation, concatenation, and methods

# Instructions:
# Strings are text values in Ruby. You can manipulate them with many built-in methods
# for changing case, length, searching, and more.

# Your task is to implement string manipulation methods.
# Look at the test failures to understand what each method should do.

# 1. Create a method that returns a string in uppercase
def shout(text)
  # Use string methods to convert to uppercase
end

# 2. Create a method that reverses a string
def reverse_text(text)
  # Use string methods to reverse the text

end

# 3. Create a method that returns the length of a string
def text_length(text)
  # Your code here

end
