# Advanced Enumerables Exercise
# Master Ruby's powerful enumerable methods for data processing

# Instructions:
# Ruby's Enumerable module provides many methods beyond basic each.
# These methods enable functional programming patterns and data transformation.

# Your task is to implement the methods that the tests expect.
# Look at the test failures to understand what each method should do.

# 1. Advanced Iteration Methods
# Create a method that uses each_with_index
def number_items(items)
  # Return array of "1. item", "2. item", etc.
end

# Create a method that uses each_with_object
def count_by_first_letter(words)
  # Return hash counting words by first letter
end

# 2. Filtering and Selection
# Create a method that uses select and reject together
def partition_numbers(numbers)
  # Return [even_numbers, odd_numbers]
end

# Create a method that uses find/detect
def find_first_long_word(words, min_length)
  # Find first word with length >= min_length
end

# 3. Transformation Methods
# Create a method that uses map with index
def square_with_position(numbers)
  # Return array of "number^2 at position X"
end

# Create a method that uses collect_concat/flat_map
def explode_words(sentences)
  # Split each sentence into words, return flat array
end

# 4. Aggregation Methods
# Create a method that uses reduce/inject for custom aggregation
def calculate_statistics(numbers)
  # Return hash with :sum, :average, :min, :max
end

# Create a method that uses group_by
def group_words_by_length(words)
  # Return hash with length as key, words array as value
end

# 5. Chaining Methods
# Create a method that chains multiple enumerable methods
def process_user_data(users)
  # Filter adults, map to names, sort, return first 5
  # users format: [{name: "Alice", age: 25}, ...]
end

# Create a method that uses take, drop, and take_while
def process_scores(scores)
  # Drop lowest 2, take while < 90, return average
end

# 6. Advanced Patterns
# Create a method that uses zip
def combine_arrays(names, ages, cities)
  # Combine into array of hashes with :name, :age, :city
end

# Create a method that uses chunk
def group_consecutive_numbers(numbers)
  # Group consecutive numbers together
end

# Example usage (uncomment these to test your code):
# puts number_items(["apple", "banana", "cherry"])
# puts count_by_first_letter(["apple", "banana", "avocado"])
# puts partition_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
# puts find_first_long_word(["cat", "elephant", "dog"], 5)
# puts square_with_position([1, 2, 3])
# puts explode_words(["hello world", "ruby rocks"])
# puts calculate_statistics([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
# puts group_words_by_length(["cat", "dog", "elephant", "ant"])
# users = [{name: "Alice", age: 25}, {name: "Bob", age: 17}]
# puts process_user_data(users)
# puts process_scores([60, 70, 85, 95, 88, 92, 78])
# puts combine_arrays(["Alice", "Bob"], [25, 30], ["NYC", "LA"])
# puts group_consecutive_numbers([1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10])
