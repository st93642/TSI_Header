  "description": "Solve systems of linear equations using matrix methods. Convert the system to matrix form and apply appropriate solution techniques.\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. Convert the system to matrix form AX = B\n2. Determine if the system has a unique solution, infinite solutions, or no solution\n3. Solve using appropriate method (inverse, Gauss elimination, or Cramer's rule)\n4. Verify your solution by substitution\n\n**System 1 (Unique Solution):**\n```\n2x + 3y = 8\nx - y = 1\n```\n\n**System 2 (Infinite Solutions):**\n```\nx + 2y = 4\n2x + 4y = 8\n```\n\n**System 3 (No Solution):**\n```\nx + y = 3\nx + y = 5\n```\n\n**Matrix Form:**\nFor a system of equations, write as AX = B where:\n- A is the coefficient matrix\n- X is the variable vector [x, y, z, ...]ᵀ\n- B is the constant vector\n\n**Solution Methods:**\n- If det(A) ≠ 0: Unique solution using X = A⁻¹B\n- If det(A) = 0: May have infinite solutions or no solution",
