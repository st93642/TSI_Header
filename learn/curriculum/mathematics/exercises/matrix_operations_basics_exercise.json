Given two matrices A and B, compute A + B and find the result of scalar multiplication.\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. Add matrices A and B element-wise\n2. Multiply matrix A by scalar k = 3\n3. Verify the dimensions are compatible for addition\n\n**Matrix A:**\n```\n[ 2  4  1 ]\n[ 3  1  5 ]\n```\n\n**Matrix B:**\n```\n[ 1  2  3 ]\n[ 4  0  2 ]\n```\n\n**Scalar k = 3**\n\nCompute:\n- A + B\n- k × A\n\nShow your work and provide the final matrices.",
