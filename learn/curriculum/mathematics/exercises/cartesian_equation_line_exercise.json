  "solution": "## Cartesian Equation of a Line\n\n### Symmetric Form:\n\\(\\frac{x - x_1}{a} = \\frac{y - y_1}{b} = \\frac{z - z_1}{c}\\)\n\nWhere:\n- \\((x_1, y_1, z_1)\\) is a point on the line\n- \\((a, b, c)\\) are the direction ratios\n\n### Converting from Vector Form:\nFrom \\(\\mathbf{r} = (x_1, y_1, z_1) + t(a, b, c)\\):\n\\(x = x_1 + t a\\)\n\\(y = y_1 + t b\\)\n\\(z = z_1 + t c\\)\n\nSolving for t: \\(t = \\frac{x - x_1}{a} = \\frac{y - y_1}{b} = \\frac{z - z_1}{c}\\)\n\n### Practice Problems:\n\n1. **Basic Cartesian Equation:**\n   Vector form: \\(\\mathbf{r} = (1, 2, 3) + t(2, 3, 4)\\)\n   Cartesian: \\(\\frac{x - 1}{2} = \\frac{y - 2}{3} = \\frac{z - 3}{4}\\)\n\n2. **Two Points Form:**\n   Points A(1, 2, 3) and B(3, 5, 7)\n   Direction ratios: 3-1=2, 5-2=3, 7-3=4\n   \\(\\frac{x - 1}{2} = \\frac{y - 2}{3} = \\frac{z - 3}{4}\\)\n\n3. **Parallel to Axes:**\n   Parallel to x-axis: direction (1, 0, 0)\n   Through (1, 2, 3): \\(\\frac{x - 1}{1} = \\frac{y - 2}{0} = \\frac{z - 3}{0}\\)\n   This is invalid (division by zero)\n   Better: y = 2, z = 3\n\n4. **General Point:**\n   For line \\(\\frac{x - 1}{2} = \\frac{y - 2}{3} = \\frac{z - 3}{4} = t\\)\n   Any point: x = 1 + 2t, y = 2 + 3t, z = 3 + 4t\n\n5. **Intersection with Planes:**\n   To find intersection with plane, substitute parametric equations into plane equation and solve for t.\n\n### Important Notes:\n- Direction ratios can be any non-zero multiples\n- If any direction ratio is zero, that coordinate is constant\n- The equation represents the same line regardless of which point is chosen\n- Useful for finding intersections and distances\n\n### Applications:\n- **Geometry:** Line-plane intersections, distance calculations\n- **Physics:** Trajectory analysis, ray optics\n- **Computer Graphics:** Line clipping, rendering\n- **Engineering:** Structural design, surveying"
