  "solution": "## General Equation of a Plane\n\n### Standard Form:\n\\(ax + by + cz + d = 0\\)\n\nWhere a, b, c are components of the normal vector, and d is related to the distance from origin.\n\n### Converting from Vector Form:\nFrom \\(\\mathbf{r} \\cdot (a, b, c) = -d\\):\n\\(x*a + y*b + z*c = -d\\)\n\\(ax + by + cz + d = 0\\)\n\n### Normal Vector:\n\\(\\mathbf{n} = (a, b, c)\\)\n\n### Distance from Origin:\n\\(\\frac{|d|}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}\\)\n\n### Practice Problems:\n\n1. **Basic General Equation:**\n   Vector form: \\(\\mathbf{r} \\cdot (2, 3, 4) = 5\\)\n   General form: 2x + 3y + 4z - 5 = 0\n\n2. **Three Points Form:**\n   Points A(1,1,1), B(2,1,1), C(1,2,1)\n   Normal: (B-A) × (C-A) = (1,0,0) × (0,1,0) = (0,0,1)\n   Equation: 0*x + 0*y + 1*z - 1 = 0\n   Or: z = 1\n\n3. **Parallel to Coordinate Planes:**\n   Parallel to xy-plane: normal (0,0,1), so z = constant\n   Parallel to xz-plane: normal (0,1,0), so y = constant\n   Parallel to yz-plane: normal (1,0,0), so x = constant\n\n4. **Intercept Form:**\n   If plane cuts axes at a, b, c:\n   \\(\\frac{x}{a} + \\frac{y}{b} + \\frac{z}{c} = 1\\)\n\n5. **Normal Form:**\n   \\(\\frac{ax + by + cz}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}} = -\\frac{d}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}\\)\n   Or: \\(x \\cos \\alpha + y \\cos \\beta + z \\cos \\gamma = p\\)\n   Where p is distance from origin.\n\n### Important Notes:\n- Coefficients a, b, c are not unique (can multiply by constant)\n- Normal vector determines orientation\n- Distance formula gives perpendicular distance from origin\n- General form is most useful for calculations\n\n### Applications:\n- **Geometry:** Plane representations, intersections\n- **Physics:** Constraint equations, boundaries\n- **Computer Graphics:** Clipping, visibility\n- **Engineering:** Structural design, optimization"
