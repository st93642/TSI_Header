Vectors are fundamental to describing quantities that have both size and orientation.\n\n**Vector Representation:**\n- **Geometric**: Directed line segment with arrowhead\n- **Algebraic**: Ordered tuple of real numbers \\((a_1, a_2, a_3)\\) in 3D space\n- **Notation**: Bold letters \\(\\mathbf{a}\\), arrows \\(\\vec{a}\\), or column matrices\n\n**Position Vectors:** Vectors that start from the origin (0,0,0) and end at a point (x,y,z) are called position vectors.\n\n**Free Vectors vs. Bound Vectors:**\n- **Free vectors**: Can be moved parallel to themselves (only magnitude and direction matter)\n- **Bound vectors**: Fixed starting point (like position vectors)\n\n**Vector Equality:** Two vectors are equal if they have the same magnitude and direction, regardless of their starting points.\n\n### Practice Problems:\n\n1. **Identify vectors in real life:**\n   - Velocity of a moving car\n   - Force applied to an object\n   - Electric field at a point\n   - Wind direction and speed\n\n2. **Vector representation:**\n   - Point A(3,4,5) has position vector \\(\\vec{OA} = (3,4,5)\\)\n   - Vector from A to B: \\(\\vec{AB} = \\vec{OB} - \\vec{OA}\\)\n\n3. **Vector properties:**\n   - Zero vector: \\(\\mathbf{0} = (0,0,0)\\) - has zero magnitude, no specific direction\n   - Unit vector: Vector with magnitude 1, denoted \\(\\hat{a} = \\frac{\\mathbf{a}}{|\\mathbf{a}|}\\)\n\n4. **Vector magnitude (norm):**\n   For vector \\(\\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2, a_3)\\):\n   \\(|\\mathbf{a}| = \\sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2}\\)\n\n### Important Distinctions:\n- **Vectors** have magnitude and direction\n- **Scalars** have only magnitude (real numbers)\n- **Points** are positions in space\n- **Matrices** are arrays of numbers\n\n### Applications:\nVectors are used in:\n- Physics (mechanics, electromagnetism)\n- Computer graphics (transformations, lighting)\n- Engineering (structural analysis, fluid dynamics)\n- Navigation (GPS, flight paths)\n- Machine learning (feature vectors, embeddings)"
