  "description": "Practice basic matrix arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, and multiplication by a scalar. Understand the requirements for these operations.\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. Add matrices A and B\n2. Subtract matrix B from matrix A\n3. Multiply matrix A by scalar k = 2\n4. Multiply matrix B by scalar m = -1\n5. Verify that scalar multiplication is distributive: k(A + B) = kA + kB\n\n**Matrix A:**\n```\n[ 3  1  4 ]\n[ 2  5  6 ]\n```\n\n**Matrix B:**\n```\n[ 1  2  3 ]\n[ 4  0  1 ]\n```\n\n**Scalars:** k = 2, m = -1\n\n**Requirements to remember:**\n- Addition/subtraction require same dimensions\n- Scalar multiplication works with any matrix\n- Operations are performed element-wise for addition/subtraction\n- Each element is multiplied by the scalar",

  "solution": "**1. Matrix Addition (A + B):**\n```\n[ 3+1  1+2  4+3 ]\n[ 2+4  5+0  6+1 ]\n```\n= \n[ 4  3  7 ]\n[ 6  5  7 ]\n\n**2. Matrix Subtraction (A - B):**\n```\n[ 3-1  1-2  4-3 ]\n[ 2-4  5-0  6-1 ]\n```\n= \n[ 2  -1  1 ]\n[ -2  5  5 ]\n\n**3.
