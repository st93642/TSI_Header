  "description": "Use Gaussian elimination to solve the following system of linear equations:\n\n**System of equations:**\n```\n2x + 3y - z = 8\n4x - 2y + 3z = 4\n3x + y - 2z = 9\n```\n\n**Steps to follow:**\n1. Write the augmented matrix\n2. Use row operations to get the matrix in row echelon form\n3. Back-substitute to find the solution\n4. Verify your solution by substitution\n\nShow all your work including each row operation performed.",

    "Start with the augmented matrix: [2 3 -1 | 8; 4 -2 3 | 4; 3 1 -2 | 9]",
    "Use row operations: multiply row by scalar, add multiple of one row to another",
    "Aim for upper triangular form (row echelon form)",
    "Back-substitute from bottom to top",
