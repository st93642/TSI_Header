## Adding New Content

The mathematics module is designed to be extensible. To add new workbooks, exercises, or quizzes:

1. Add PDF workbooks to the `workbooks/` directory
2. Create exercise JSON files in the `exercises/` directory
3. Create quiz JSON files in the `quizzes/` directory
4. Update the curriculum structure in `curriculum.json`

More workbooks and topics will be added as the mathematics curriculum expands!
