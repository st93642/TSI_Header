    {
      "question": "What is the condition for two vectors to be perpendicular?",
      "options": [
        "a × b = 0",
        "a · b = 0",
        "|a| = |b|",
        "a = b"

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Two vectors are perpendicular if their dot product is zero."

      "question": "Are vectors a=(2,3,1) and b=(1,-2,4) perpendicular?",
      "options": [
        "Yes",
        "No",
        "Cannot determine",
        "Only in 2D"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "a · b = 2*1 + 3*(-2) + 1*4 = 2 - 6 + 4 = 0, so they are perpendicular."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of these vectors is perpendicular to (1,2,3)?",
      "options": [
        "(2,4,6)",
        "(1,-1,1)",
        "(1,-2,1)",
        "(3,2,1)"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "(1,2,3) · (1,-2,1) = 1*1 + 2*(-2) + 3*1 = 1 - 4 + 3 = 0, so they are perpendicular."
    },
    {
      "question": "The zero vector is perpendicular to:",

        "No vectors",
        "Only itself",
        "All vectors",
        "Only unit vectors"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The dot product of the zero vector with any vector is always zero, so it is perpendicular to all vectors."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can two parallel non-zero vectors be perpendicular?",
      "options": [
        "Yes, always",
        "Yes, sometimes",
        "No, never",
        "Only in 2D space"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Parallel non-zero vectors have a dot product equal to |a||b|, which is only zero if one vector is zero. So they are never perpendicular."
