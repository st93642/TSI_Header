    {
      "question": "What is det(A×B) in terms of det(A) and det(B)?",

        "det(A) / det(B)"

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "det(AB) = det(A) × det(B) for square matrices."

      "question": "What happens to det(A) when two rows are interchanged?",
      "options": [
        "Stays the same",
        "Doubles",
        "Changes sign",
        "Becomes zero"

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Interchanging two rows changes the sign of the determinant."

        "-det(A)",

        "0"

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "det(Aᵀ) = det(A) - the transpose doesn't change the determinant."

      "options": [
        "k × det(A)",
