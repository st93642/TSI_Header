      "question": "What is the condition for three vectors to be coplanar?",

      "options": [
        "Yes",
        "No",
        "Cannot determine",
        "Only in 2D"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The scalar triple product is zero, so they are coplanar."

      "question": "Which of these indicates that three vectors are linearly dependent?",
      "options": [
        "Their dot products are zero",

        "Their scalar triple product is zero",
        "Their magnitudes are equal"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Linear dependence of three vectors is equivalent to their scalar triple product being zero."

      "question": "Can any two vectors be coplanar?",
      "options": [
        "Yes, always",
        "No, never",
        "Only if they are parallel",
        "Only if they are perpendicular"

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Any two vectors always lie in the same plane, so they are always coplanar."

      "question": "What does a non-zero scalar triple product indicate?",
      "options": [
        "Vectors are parallel",
        "Vectors are perpendicular",
        "Vectors are coplanar",
        "Vectors form a 3D basis"

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "A non-zero scalar triple product means the vectors are linearly independent and span 3D space."
