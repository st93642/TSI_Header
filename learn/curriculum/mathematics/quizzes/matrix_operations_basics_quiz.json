  "difficulty": "intermediate",
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the result of adding matrices A and B where A = [1 2; 3 4] and B = [5 6; 7 8]?",
      "options": [
        "[6 8; 10 12]",
        "[4 4; 4 4]",
        "[5 12; 21 32]",
        "[1 2 5 6; 3 4 7 8]"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Matrix addition is performed element-wise: (A + B)[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j]"
    },
    {
      "question": "If matrix A has dimensions 2×3 and matrix B has dimensions 2×3, what are the dimensions of A + B?",
      "options": [
        "2×3",
        "3×2",
        "2×2",
        "3×3"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Matrix addition requires both matrices to have the same dimensions, and the result has the same dimensions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the result of scalar multiplication 3 × [2 4; 1 3]?",
      "options": [
        "[6 12; 3 9]",
        "[5 7; 4 6]",
        "[2 4 3; 1 3 3]",
        "[6 7; 12 13]"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Scalar multiplication multiplies each element by the scalar: (k × A)[i][j] = k × A[i][j]"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a property of matrix addition?",
      "options": [
        "Commutative: A + B = B + A",
        "Associative: (A + B) + C = A + (B + C)",
        "Distributive: A × (B + C) = A × B + A × C",
        "Identity element exists: A + 0 = A"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The distributive property applies to scalar multiplication over matrix addition, not matrix multiplication over matrix addition."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the dimensions of a matrix with 3 rows and 4 columns?",
      "options": [
        "3×4",
        "4×3",
        "7×1",
        "1×12"

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Matrix dimensions are always written as rows × columns."
