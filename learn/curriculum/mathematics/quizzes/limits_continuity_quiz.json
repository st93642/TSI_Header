    {
      "question": "What is the limit of a function f(x) as x approaches a?",
      "options": [
        "The value of f(a)",
        "The value that f(x) approaches as x gets closer to a",
        "The derivative at x = a",
        "The integral from 0 to a"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A limit describes the behavior of a function near a point, not necessarily at the point."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between left-hand and right-hand limits?",
      "options": [
        "Left from negative side, right from positive side",
        "Left is always smaller, right is always larger",
        "Left is for decreasing functions, right for increasing",
        "There is no difference"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Left-hand limit approaches from values less than a, right-hand from values greater than a."

        "All of the above"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Continuity requires the function to be defined at a, the limit to exist, and them to be equal."

    {
      "question": "What are equivalent infinitesimals?",
      "options": [
        "Functions that approach the same limit",
        "Functions whose ratio approaches 1",
        "Functions that are both zero",
        "Functions with the same derivative"

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Two infinitesimals α(x) and β(x) are equivalent if lim α(x)/β(x) = 1."

      "question": "Which of the following is a property of limits?",
      "options": [
        "lim (f + g) = lim f + lim g",
        "lim (f · g) = lim f · lim g",

        "All of the above"

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Limits follow algebraic properties for sums, products, and quotients."
