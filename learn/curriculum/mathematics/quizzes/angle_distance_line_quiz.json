    {
      "question": "How do you find the angle between two lines?",
      "options": [
        "Add their direction vectors",
        "Take dot product of direction vectors",
        "Take cross product of direction vectors",
        "Subtract their position vectors"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "cos θ = |b₁ · b₂| / (|b₁| |b₂|), using the dot product of direction vectors."

      "question": "The angle between lines is always:",
      "options": [
        "Acute",
        "Obtuse",
        "Right angle",
        "Between 0° and 180°"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The angle between lines is defined as the acute angle, so it's always between 0° and 90°."

      "question": "What does distance = 0 indicate?",
      "options": [
        "Lines are parallel",
        "Lines are perpendicular",
        "Point lies on the line",
        "Lines intersect"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "If the distance from a point to a line is zero, the point lies on the line."

      "question": "The formula for distance from point to line uses:",
      "options": [
        "Dot product only",
        "Cross product only",
        "Both dot and cross products",
        "Neither dot nor cross products"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Distance = |(c - a) × b| / |b|, using the cross product."

      "options": [
        "cos θ = 0",

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Perpendicular lines have direction vectors with dot product zero, so cos θ = 0."
