  "description": "Test your understanding of Gaussian elimination and solving systems of linear equations.",
  "difficulty": "advanced",
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the first step in Gaussian elimination?",
      "options": [
        "Write the system as an augmented matrix",
        "Back-substitute to find variables",
        "Check the solution by substitution",
        "Find the determinant"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Gaussian elimination begins by representing the system of equations as an augmented matrix."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which row operation is NOT allowed in Gaussian elimination?",
      "options": [
        "Multiply a row by a non-zero scalar",
        "Add a multiple of one row to another row",
        "Swap two rows",
        "Multiply two rows together"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "You can multiply a row by a scalar, add multiples of rows, and swap rows, but you cannot multiply two rows together."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does it mean when you get a row like [0 0 0 | 5] in Gaussian elimination?",
      "options": [
        "The system has infinitely many solutions",
        "The system has a unique solution",
        "The system has no solution (inconsistent)",
        "You made a calculation error"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "A row [0 0 0 | 5] means 0x + 0y + 0z = 5, which is 0 = 5, an impossible equation indicating an inconsistent system."
    },
    {
      "question": "In which form should the matrix be for back-substitution?",
      "options": [
        "Upper triangular form",
        "Lower triangular form",
        "Diagonal form",
        "Identity form"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "After forward elimination, the matrix should be in upper triangular form (also called row echelon form) for back-substitution."
    },
    {
      "question": "For the system: 2x + y = 5, 4x + 2y = 10, what is the solution?",
      "options": [
        "x = 2.5, y = 0",
        "x = 0, y = 5",
        "Infinitely many solutions",
        "No solution"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The second equation is 2 Ã— (first equation), so the system is dependent. The augmented matrix becomes [2 1 | 5; 0 0 | 0], indicating infinitely many solutions, but actually this represents the same equation twice, so there are infinitely many solutions."
