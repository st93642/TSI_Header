      "explanation": "Dot product: 2*1 + 3*(-1) + 1*4 = 2 - 3 + 4 = 3"

        "Associative",
        "Positive definite"

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The dot product is not associative: (a·b)·c is not defined."

      "question": "What does the dot product a·b = 0 indicate?",
      "options": [
        "Vectors are equal",

        "Vectors are perpendicular",
        "Vectors have same magnitude"

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "When the dot product is zero, the vectors are perpendicular."
