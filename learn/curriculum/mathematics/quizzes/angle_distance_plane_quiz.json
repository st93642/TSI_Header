    {
      "question": "How do you find the angle between two planes?",
      "options": [
        "Add their normal vectors",
        "Take dot product of normal vectors",
        "Take cross product of normal vectors",
        "Subtract their constants"

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "cos θ = |n₁ · n₂| / (|n₁| |n₂|), using the dot product of normal vectors."

        "Right angle",
        "Between 0° and 180°"

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The angle between planes is defined as the acute angle, so it's always between 0° and 90°."

      "question": "What does distance = 0 indicate for point to plane?",
      "options": [
        "Planes are parallel",

        "Point lies on the plane",
        "Planes intersect"

      "explanation": "If the distance from a point to a plane is zero, the point lies on the plane."

      "question": "The formula for distance from point to plane uses:",
      "options": [
        "Dot product only",

        "Both dot and cross products",
        "Neither dot nor cross products"

      "explanation": "Perpendicular planes have normal vectors with dot product zero, so cos θ = 0."
