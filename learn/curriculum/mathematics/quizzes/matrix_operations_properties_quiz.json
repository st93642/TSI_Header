    {
      "question": "Which of these is NOT a property of matrix addition?",
      "options": [
        "Commutative: A + B = B + A",
        "Associative: (A + B) + C = A + (B + C)",

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The distributive property applies to scalar multiplication, not matrix multiplication."

        "Identity matrix I",
        "Zero matrix 0",
        "Any scalar matrix",
        "Any diagonal matrix"

        "Distributivity",

      "question": "What is true about matrix multiplication?",
      "options": [
        "Always commutative",
        "Associative but not commutative",
        "Neither associative nor commutative",
        "Commutative but not associative"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Matrix multiplication is associative: (AB)C = A(BC), but not commutative: AB ≠ BA."

      "question": "What is the result of A × I where I is the identity matrix?",
      "options": [
        "Zero matrix",

        "I itself",
        "Undefined"

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The identity matrix acts as the multiplicative identity: A × I = I × A = A."
