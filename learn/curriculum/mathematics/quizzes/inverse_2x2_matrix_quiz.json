  "difficulty": "intermediate",
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the inverse of [1 2; 3 4]?",
      "options": [
        "[4 -2; -3 1]",
        "[-2 1; 1.5 -0.5]",
        "[4 2; 3 4]",
        "Does not exist"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "det = -2, so A⁻¹ = (1/-2)×[4 -2; -3 1] = [-2 1; 1.5 -0.5]"
    },
    {
      "question": "For which 2×2 matrix does the inverse not exist?",
      "options": [
        "[1 0; 0 1]",
        "[1 2; 2 4]",
        "[2 1; 1 3]",
        "[0 1; 1 0]"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Matrix [1 2; 2 4] has det = 0, so it's singular."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the first step in finding a 2×2 inverse?",
      "options": [
        "Find the transpose",
        "Calculate the determinant",
        "Find the cofactor matrix",
        "Multiply by the adjoint"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "First check if det ≠ 0, then use the formula."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the inverse of the identity matrix I₂?",
      "options": [
        "I₂ itself",
        "Zero matrix",
        "-I₂",
        "Does not exist"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The inverse of the identity matrix is itself."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the 2×2 inverse formula, what replaces the diagonal elements?",
      "options": [
        "They stay the same",
        "They are negated",
        "They are swapped",
        "They become zero"

      "correct": 2,
