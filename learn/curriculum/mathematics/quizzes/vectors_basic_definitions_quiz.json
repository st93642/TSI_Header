      "question": "What are the two essential properties that define a vector?",
      "options": [
        "Magnitude and position",
        "Magnitude and direction",
        "Direction and position",
        "Position and orientation"

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A vector has both magnitude (size/length) and direction."

      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a vector quantity?",
      "options": [
        "Velocity",
        "Force",
        "Temperature",
        "Acceleration"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Temperature is a scalar quantity (has magnitude only), while velocity, force, and acceleration are vector quantities."

        "12",
        "25"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Magnitude = √(3² + 4² + 0²) = √(9 + 16 + 0) = √25 = 5"

    {
      "question": "What is a position vector?",
      "options": [
        "A vector with magnitude 1",
        "A vector from the origin to a point",
        "A vector with no direction",
        "A vector in the xy-plane only"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A position vector starts from the origin (0,0,0) and ends at a specific point in space."

      "question": "When are two vectors considered equal?",
      "options": [
        "When they have the same starting point",
        "When they have the same magnitude and direction",
        "When they have the same magnitude only",
        "When they are both unit vectors"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Two vectors are equal if they have the same magnitude and the same direction, regardless of their starting points."
