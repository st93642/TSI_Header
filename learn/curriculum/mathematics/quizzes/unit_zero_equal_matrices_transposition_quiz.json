    {
      "question": "What is the transpose of matrix [1 2; 3 4]?",
      "options": [
        "[1 3; 2 4]",

        "[2 4; 1 3]"

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Transposition swaps rows and columns: element (i,j) becomes element (j,i)."

      "question": "When are two matrices A and B equal?",
      "options": [
        "When they have the same number of elements",

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Matrices are equal if they have identical dimensions and corresponding elements are equal."

      "question": "What is special about the identity matrix I?",
      "options": [
        "All elements are zero",
        "It has 1s on the main diagonal and 0s elsewhere",
        "All elements are 1",
        "It has 1s everywhere except diagonal"

        "3×3",
