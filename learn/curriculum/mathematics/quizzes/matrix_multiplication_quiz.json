    {
      "question": "For matrices A (m×n) and B (n×p) to be multiplied, what must be true?",
      "options": [
        "m = p",
        "m = n",
        "n = p",
        "Columns of A = rows of B"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The number of columns in A must equal the number of rows in B."
    },

      "question": "What are the dimensions of the product of a 2×3 matrix and a 3×4 matrix?",
      "options": [
        "2×3",
        "3×4",
        "2×4",
        "4×2"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "(m×n) × (n×p) = (m×p)"

    {
      "question": "Which property does matrix multiplication have?",
      "options": [
        "Commutativity: AB = BA",
        "Associativity: (AB)C = A(BC)",
        "Distributivity: A(B+C) = AB + AC",
        "Identity: A×I = I×A"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Matrix multiplication is associative but not commutative."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the element in position (1,1) of the product [1 2; 3 4] × [5 6; 7 8]?",
      "options": [
        "5",
        "19",
        "22",
        "43"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "C₁₁ = 1×5 + 2×7 = 5 + 14 = 19"

      "question": "When is AB = BA for matrices A and B?",
      "options": [
        "Always",
        "When A and B are square matrices",
        "When A and B commute",
        "Never"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "AB = BA only when the matrices commute, which is not guaranteed."
