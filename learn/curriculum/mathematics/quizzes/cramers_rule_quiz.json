      "question": "In Cramer's rule, xᵢ = det(Aᵢ) / det(A). What is Aᵢ?",
      "options": [
        "A with row i removed",
        "A with column i removed",
        "A with column i replaced by the constant vector",
        "A with row i replaced by the constant vector"

      "question": "When can Cramer's rule NOT be used?",
      "options": [
        "When the system is 2×2",
