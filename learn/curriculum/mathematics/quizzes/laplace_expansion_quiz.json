    {
      "question": "What is the cofactor C₁₁ for matrix [1 2; 3 4]?",
      "options": [
        "4",
        "(-1)^(1+1)×4 = 4",
        "(-1)^(1+1)×1 = 1",
        "(-1)^(1+2)×2 = -2"

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "C₁₁ = (-1)^(1+1) × det([4]) = 1 × 4 = 4"

      "question": "Laplace expansion can be performed along:",
      "options": [
        "Only the first row",
        "Only the main diagonal",
        "Any row or column",
        "Only rows"

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Expansion can be done along any row or any column."

      "question": "What is the sign pattern for cofactors?",
      "options": [
        "All positive",
        "Alternating based on position",
        "Depends on matrix elements",
        "Always negative for even positions"

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Cofactor signs follow (-1)^(i+j) pattern."

      "question": "When calculating a 4×4 determinant using Laplace expansion, how many 3×3 determinants do you need to calculate?",
      "options": [
        "1",

        "16",
        "24"

      "explanation": "Expanding along one row gives 4 cofactors, each requiring one 3×3 determinant."

      "options": [
        "Row or column with most zeros",
