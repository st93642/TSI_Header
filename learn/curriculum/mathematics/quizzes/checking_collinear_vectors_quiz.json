    {
      "question": "What is the condition for two vectors to be collinear?",
      "options": [
        "a · b = 0",
        "a × b = 0",
        "|a| = |b|",
        "a = b"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Two vectors are collinear if their cross product is zero."

      "question": "Are vectors a=(2,4,6) and b=(1,2,3) collinear?",
      "options": [
        "Yes",
        "No",
        "Cannot determine",
        "Only in 2D"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The ratios are 2/1 = 4/2 = 6/3 = 2, so they are collinear."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which test is definitive for checking collinearity?",
      "options": [
        "Dot product equals zero",
        "Magnitudes are equal",
        "Cross product equals zero",
        "Components are equal"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The cross product being zero is the definitive test for collinearity."

      "question": "The zero vector is collinear with:",
      "options": [
        "No vectors",
        "Only itself",
        "All vectors",
        "Only unit vectors"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The zero vector is collinear with all vectors since it can be expressed as a scalar multiple of any vector."

      "question": "Can two perpendicular non-zero vectors be collinear?",
      "options": [
        "Yes, always",
        "Yes, sometimes",
        "No, never",
        "Only in 2D space"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Perpendicular vectors have a non-zero cross product, so they cannot be collinear."
