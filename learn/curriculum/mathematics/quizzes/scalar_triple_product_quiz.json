  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the scalar triple product of vectors a, b, and c?",
      "options": [
        "a × (b × c)",
        "a · (b × c)",
        "a × (b · c)",
        "(a × b) × c"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The scalar triple product is defined as a · (b × c), which is a scalar quantity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which property states that a · (b × c) = b · (c × a) = c · (a × b)?",
      "options": [
        "Anti-commutativity",
        "Cyclic permutation",
        "Distributivity",
        "Associativity"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The cyclic permutation property allows rearranging the vectors in the triple product while preserving the value."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the scalar triple product equal to zero indicate?",
      "options": [
        "Vectors are parallel",
        "Vectors are perpendicular",
        "Vectors are coplanar",
        "Vectors form a right angle"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "If a · (b × c) = 0, the vectors a, b, and c are coplanar (lie in the same plane)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What geometric interpretation does |a · (b × c)| represent?",
      "options": [
        "Area of triangle formed by two vectors",
        "Volume of parallelepiped formed by three vectors",
        "Length of the resultant vector",
        "Angle between two vectors"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The absolute value of the scalar triple product gives the volume of the parallelepiped formed by the three vectors."

      "question": "Calculate a · (b × c) for a=(1,0,0), b=(0,1,0), c=(0,0,1).",

        "1",
        "2",
        "3"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "b × c = (0,1,0) × (0,0,1) = (1,0,0), so a · (1,0,0) = 1. This represents the volume of the unit cube."
