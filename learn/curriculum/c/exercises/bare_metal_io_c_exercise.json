  "description": "Build a small console program that prints a preset student summary, gathers weekly study habits from the user, and reports the results using classic stdio functions.\n\nSteps:\n1. Start with the provided constants for the student's name, programme, total credits, and completed credits. Print each value on its own line using `printf`.\n2. Calculate `remainingCredits` and `completionPercentage` (remember to cast to `double` before dividing). Display both with clear labels; format the percentage with one digit after the decimal point.\n3. Prompt the user for `studyDays` and `minutesPerDay` using `printf`/`scanf`, reading two integers.\n4. Compute `totalMinutes` and `averagePerDay`; protect the division so `averagePerDay` becomes `0.0` when `studyDays` is zero.\n5. Print the study-time summary so the output matches the expectations exactly, compiling with `gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror` to keep the build warning-free.\n\nInput format:\nTwo integers provided by the user: study days on the first line, minutes per day on the second.\n\nExpected output:\nStudent: Alice Johnson\nProgramme: Computer Science\nTotal credits: 180\nCompleted credits: 32\nRemaining credits: 148\nCompletion percentage: 17.8%\nEnter study days in a week:\nEnter minutes per day:\nTotal minutes: 600\nAverage per day: 120.0\n\nExample run:\n$ ./student_snapshot\nStudent: Alice Johnson\nProgramme: Computer Science\nTotal credits: 180\nCompleted credits: 32\nRemaining credits: 148\nCompletion percentage: 17.8%\nEnter study days in a week:\nEnter minutes per day:\nTotal minutes: 600\nAverage per day: 120.0",
