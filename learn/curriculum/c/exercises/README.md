# Exercises Placeholder

Exercise definitions for the forthcoming C track belong here. Follow the existing convention:

- File name: `<lesson_id>_exercise.json`
- Include `description` with **Steps** and **Expected output/results** sections.
- Provide `starterCode`, `tests`, `hints`, and `tags` fields so Learn Mode can scaffold and evaluate student work.
