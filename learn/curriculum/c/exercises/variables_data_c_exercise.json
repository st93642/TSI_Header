  "description": "Build a console programme that captures a student's completed credits and weekly study effort, then reports remaining work using precise arithmetic and clear formatting.\n\nSteps:\n1. Define constants for `TOTAL_CREDITS`, `CREDITS_PER_SEMESTER`, and `TUITION_PER_CREDIT` using `const` (plus a macro if you want to mirror the lesson). Make sure their values match the starter code comments.\n2. Prompt the user with `Enter completed credits:` and `Enter weekly study minutes:` (each followed by a newline) and read two integers. Guard the remaining credit calculation so it never drops below zero.\n3. Compute the number of semesters left in two ways: an integer ceiling value (rounded up) and a precise `double` value. Store the exact value in a separate variable to avoid implicit truncation.\n4. Convert weekly study minutes to hours (one decimal place) using an explicit cast, and calculate the remaining tuition using the per-credit constant (two decimal places).\n5. Print the report exactly as shown in the expected output, including the load warning: display `Reduce load` when weekly hours exceed 40.0; otherwise display `OK`.\n\nInput format:\n- Line 1: completed credits (integer).\n- Line 2: weekly study minutes (integer).\n\nExpected output:\nEnter completed credits:\nEnter weekly study minutes:\nCompleted credits: {value}\nRemaining credits: {value}\nSemesters remaining (rounded): {value}\nSemesters remaining (exact): {value}\nWeekly study hours: {value}\nTuition remaining: {value} EUR\nStudy load warning: {OK|Reduce load}\n\nExample run:\n$ ./progress_plan\nEnter completed credits:\nEnter weekly study minutes:\nCompleted credits: 60\nRemaining credits: 120\nSemesters remaining (rounded): 4\nSemesters remaining (exact): 4.0\nWeekly study hours: 15.0\nTuition remaining: 5100.00 EUR\nStudy load warning: OK",
