# Solutions Placeholder

Store canonical solutions for each C exercise in this directory. Solution files should be named `<lesson_id>_exercise.json` and contain the fields `exerciseId`, `languageId`, `code`, `explanation`, and `keyPoints`.

Keeping these files aligned with the exercises ensures learners can review fully working implementations after passing the tests.
