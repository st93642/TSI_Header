  "description": "Write a program that prompts for a first name and age, reads both values, and prints a personalised summary.\n\nSteps:\n1. Print the prompt `Enter your first name:` and read a single-word name using `std::cin`.\n2. Print the prompt `Enter your age:` and read an integer age using `std::cin`.\n3. Output `Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.` exactly, replacing `{name}` and `{age}` with the captured values.\n4. Output `Ready to explore iostream!` as the final line (end the line with either `std::endl` or `\\n`).\n\nInput format:\n- Line 1: first name (single word).\n- Line 2: age (integer).\n\nExpected output (exactly four lines):\nEnter your first name:\nEnter your age:\nHello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\nReady to explore iostream!\n\nExample run (input `Ada` then `21`):\nEnter your first name:\nEnter your age:\nHello, Ada! You are 21 years old.\nReady to explore iostream!",
