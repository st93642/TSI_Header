Print `Hello from the Transport and Telecommunication Institute!` and terminate the line with a newline escape (`\\n`).\n2. Print `Let's build with C++!` and terminate the line with a newline escape (`\\n`).\n3. Print `This line uses std::endl` and terminate the line with `std::endl`.\n\nExpected output (no extra blank lines or spaces):\nHello from the Transport and Telecommunication Institute!\nLet's build with C++!\nThis line uses std::endl",
