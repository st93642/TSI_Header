  "explanation": "Each variable is initialised with brace syntax to avoid narrowing. Applying std::boolalpha before printing the boolean ensures the output matches the required \"true\" literal, and each line is reported with clear labels.",
  "keyPoints": [
    "Prefer brace initialisation for safety",
    "std::boolalpha formats bool values as true/false",
    "Labelled output helps connect data to its meaning"
