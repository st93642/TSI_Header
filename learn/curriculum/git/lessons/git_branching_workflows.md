# Lesson 3.1: Feature Branching, Trunk-Based, and Gitflow

## Selecting a Branching Model

Branching policies shape collaboration velocity. Choose pragmatically:

### Branch Policy Matrix

Codify branch rules to maintain momentum:

- Require status checks and reviews before merging into protected branches.
- Use automation to delete merged branches and encourage short-lived work.
- Gate release branches with deployment smoke tests and service-level objectives.

### Environment Promotion Path

![Environment Promotion Path](../../../../resources/git/git_environment_promotion.svg)

Map code promotion to infrastructure:

- Feature branches deploy to ephemeral preview environments.
- Mainline merges trigger staging deployments with synthetic monitoring.
- Release branches promote to production via progressive delivery (canary or blue/green).

## Aligning with CI/CD

Frequent integration requires automated testing. Combine branch protection rules with status checks to enforce quality.

### Practice

- Map your teamâ€™s release cadence against these models.
- Configure branch protection rules and required reviews in a hosting provider.
- Simulate trunk-based development with a 24-hour integration window.
