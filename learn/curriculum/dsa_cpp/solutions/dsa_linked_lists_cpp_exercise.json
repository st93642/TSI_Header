  "explanation": "These answers demonstrate understanding of linked list mechanics, memory management challenges, and performance characteristics in C++.",
  "keyPoints": [
    "Linked lists provide dynamic sizing through node-based allocation, unlike fixed-size arrays",
    "Singly linked lists enable O(1) insertions/deletions at known positions but require O(n) traversal",
    "Doubly linked lists support bidirectional traversal at the cost of increased memory overhead",
    "Proper memory management with new/delete or smart pointers prevents leaks and undefined behavior",
    "Time complexity varies: O(1) for end operations with tail pointer, O(n) for position-based access",
    "Space complexity includes pointer overhead: 1 pointer for singly, 2 for doubly linked lists",
    "Common operations involve pointer manipulation: updating next/prev references during insert/delete",
    "Circular linked lists eliminate null checks for traversal but require careful cycle detection",
    "RAII principles and smart pointers simplify memory management in modern C++ implementations",
    "Choose linked lists for frequent insertions/deletions; prefer arrays/vectors for random access patterns"
