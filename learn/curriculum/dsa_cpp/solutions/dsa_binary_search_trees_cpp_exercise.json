  "keyPoints": [
    "Binary Search Trees maintain an ordering property where left subtree values < node value < right subtree values",
    "Balanced BSTs guarantee O(log n) performance for search, insert, and delete operations",
    "AVL trees maintain strict balance with height differences â‰¤ 1, using rotations to restore balance",
    "Red-Black trees use color properties and relaxed balance constraints for efficient balancing",
    "Tree rotations are fundamental operations that restructure trees while preserving BST ordering",
    "Unbalanced BSTs can degenerate to O(n) performance when insertions follow sorted order",
    "BST deletion requires different strategies for nodes with 0, 1, or 2 children",
    "The inorder successor (minimum value in right subtree) is used when deleting nodes with two children",
    "BSTs are fundamental to database indexing, symbol tables, and ordered data structures",
    "Choosing between AVL and Red-Black trees involves trade-offs in balance strictness and operation complexity"
