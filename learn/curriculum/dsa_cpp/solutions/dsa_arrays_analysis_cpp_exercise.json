  "explanation": "These answers align with the lesson's emphasis on observable arrays, layered search strategies, and storytelling dashboards that translate instrumentation into action.",
  "keyPoints": [
    "Stride equal to sizeof(T) confirms contiguous access patterns.",
    "SpanHub centralises safe slicing and ledger reuse.",
    "Linear search remains viable for small or front-heavy datasets.",
    "Galloping search bounds the region before delegating to binary search.",
    "Interpolation search needs empty and denominator guards to remain safe.",
    "Selection sort balances predictable comparisons with low swap counts.",
    "Insertion sort excels when data is nearly sorted.",
    "Diagnostic narratives require context, observation, interpretation, and recommendation.",
    "Instrumented harnesses should be committed with regression tests.",
    "Resetting the ledger keeps experiments comparable across runs."
