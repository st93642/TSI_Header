  "keyPoints": [
    "Hash tables achieve average O(1) performance through key-to-index mapping, making them ideal for fast lookups when order doesn't matter.",
    "Separate chaining uses linked lists per bucket for collision resolution, offering simplicity and good performance at high load factors.",
    "Hash functions must be deterministic, fast, and provide uniform distribution to ensure optimal table performance.",
    "Load factor management is crucial - keeping it below 0.75 prevents performance degradation from excessive collisions.",
    "Open addressing provides better cache performance than separate chaining but suffers from clustering and complex deletion.",
    "Rehashing maintains performance by creating larger tables and redistributing elements when load factors become too high.",
    "Linear probing is a simple open addressing technique that searches sequentially for available slots after collisions.",
    "Open addressing requires careful load factor management and has more complex deletion semantics than separate chaining.",
    "Good hash functions exhibit the avalanche effect, ensuring small input changes produce large output variations.",
    "Hash table worst-case O(n) performance occurs with pathological collision patterns, highlighting the importance of robust hash functions."
