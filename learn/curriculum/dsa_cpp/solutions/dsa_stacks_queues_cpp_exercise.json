  "explanation": "These answers demonstrate understanding of stack and queue principles, implementation trade-offs, and C++ standard library usage.",
  "keyPoints": [
    "Stacks follow LIFO principle with O(1) push/pop operations at the top",
    "Queues follow FIFO principle with O(1) enqueue/dequeue using front/rear pointers",
    "Array-based implementations have fixed size but fast access; linked implementations are dynamic",
    "Circular queues solve space waste in array implementations by wrapping around",
    "std::stack and std::queue are adapter classes using std::deque by default",
    "Stacks excel at undo operations, function calls, and expression parsing",
    "Queues are essential for task scheduling, BFS algorithms, and resource management",
    "std::deque provides efficient operations at both ends for flexible data access",
    "Choose implementation based on size constraints, access patterns, and memory requirements",
    "Understanding LIFO/FIFO patterns enables efficient algorithm design in C++"
