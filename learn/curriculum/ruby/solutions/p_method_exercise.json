  "code": "# Solution for P Method Exercise\n\n# Task: Create a method called get_year that returns the current year as a number\n\ndef get_year\n  2025\nend",
  "explanation": "This solution demonstrates returning numbers from methods:\n\n1. **Number literals**: Simply write the number without quotes to return an integer\n\n2. **Automatic return**: Ruby returns the last expression in a method automatically\n\n3. **No quotes needed**: Numbers are not strings, so don't use quotes around them\n\n4. **Type matters**: The tests check that the return value is actually a number (Integer class)",

    "Return numbers without quotes",
    "Ruby returns the last expression automatically",
    "Numbers are Integer objects in Ruby",
