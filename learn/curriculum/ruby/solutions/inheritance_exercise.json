  "explanation": "This solution shows inheritance:\n\n1. **Base class**: Animal with basic behavior\n\n2. **Subclass syntax**: class Dog < Animal\n\n3. **Method overriding**: Subclasses can redefine inherited methods\n\n4. **Polymorphism**: Different objects respond to same method calls",

    "class Child < Parent for inheritance",
    "Superclass methods inherited automatically",
    "Override methods to customize behavior"
