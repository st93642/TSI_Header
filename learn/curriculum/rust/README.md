# Rust curriculum for Learn mode

Files:

- `curriculum.json` - metadata and modules/lessons list
- `lessons/` - markdown lesson files
- `exercises/` - exercise definitions (JSON)
- `solutions/` - reference solutions (JSON)

Lesson ID convention: lesson file names must match the `id` field in `curriculum.json`.

To test: open the command palette in VS Code and run the registered Learn command for Rust (if available), open the lesson and click "Start Practice Exercise".
