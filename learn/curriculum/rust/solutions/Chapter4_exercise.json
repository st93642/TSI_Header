  "explanation": "This solution demonstrates defining a Rectangle struct with width and height fields, implementing methods using impl blocks, and using method syntax to call them on struct instances.",
  "keyPoints": [
    "Structs are defined with the struct keyword and curly braces containing field names and types",
    "Methods are defined in impl blocks and take &self as the first parameter",
    "The area method calculates width * height",
    "The can_hold method checks if both dimensions are greater than another rectangle's dimensions",
    "Methods are called using dot notation on struct instances"
