  "description": "Create a music library system demonstrating Rust's module system. Define modules for organizing music and playlists, control visibility with pub, and use paths to access items.\n\n**What you need to implement:**\n- Define a `library` module containing `music` and `playlists` submodules\n- Create a `Song` struct in the `music` module with `title`, `artist`, and `duration` fields\n- Implement methods on `Song` including `new()` and `play()`\n- Create a `Playlist` struct in the `playlists` module with a `name` and `songs` vector\n- Implement methods on `Playlist` including `new()`, `add_song()`, and `display_info()`\n- Use `use` statements to bring items into scope in `main()`\n- Create these specific songs and add them to a playlist:\n  - \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by \"Queen\" (duration: \"5:55\")\n  - \"Hotel California\" by \"Eagles\" (duration: \"6:30\")\n- Call methods to display playlist information and play songs\n\n**Expected output:**\nYour program should produce exactly this output when run:\n```\nPlaylist: Classic Rock contains 2 songs\nSong: Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen (5:55)\nSong: Hotel California by Eagles (6:30)\nPlaying: Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen\nPlaying: Hotel California by Eagles\nTotal duration: 12:25\n```",
